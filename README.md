# Warmup Learning Challenge

This is a simple single-page homepage that shows a person's name, favorite
programming languages, and favorite foods. The favorite foods are loaded from
the Firebase dynamically.

Your objective is to host your own version of this single-page homepage.

If you are successful, you should have a site that looks like this:

### Getting data into Firebase

The data used in the example has the following structure in the JSON format:
```javascript
{
  "bio" : {
    "favorite_foods" : [ "green chilis", "burger" ]
  }
}
```

In your Firebase data browser, you want to be able to see something like this:

There are at least three methods to get your data in
1. Use the IMPORT button
2. Use the GUI to manually enter the data
3. Use the [Firebase command line tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) and the `data:set` command.
